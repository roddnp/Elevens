1. you need the deck itself
2. 1. grab the deck of cards
   2. shuffle the deck
   3. deal 9 cars
   4. check if there  are 3 different face cards (jack, queen, king), if so remove them and replace these cards with ones from the top of the shuffled deck
   5. check if there is a pair that adds up to eleven, if so remove them and replace these cards with ones from the top of the shuffled deck
   6. if there are no combinations remaining, then you lost the game, or if the deck is empty you won, else repeat steps 4 through 5
